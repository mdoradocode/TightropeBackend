    This file will use the mindfulness event data selected by the user on sign up and scan through the calendar to find an open time that we believe is a good time to practice mindfulness.

    Layout in my mind:
        1. retrieve a given users event data for next week (needs to be sent from the database, Icould cut it off here but it would waste computing power)
        2. order data by date/event 
        3. scan to find open times where time between events is greater than a time hyperparameter
        4. select the soonest time window that fits the time hyperparameter
        5. consider 
        
    NOTES: 
    This is completely contingent upon how the calendar and event_preferences are sent into this program.

    It also assumes that there are no overlapping events
        As part of this, all day events like birthdays will need to be stored separately and not fed into this program.

    Once we implement this, I will troubleshoot this again and make sure it is all working properly for normal use.

    There are probably edge cases, a reader can think of any of these, please send me a discord message.

    I also am not sure if I'm working with datetime correctly, it was a recommendation from the internet.
