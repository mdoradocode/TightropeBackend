"""
    An algorithmic method of forecasting stress levels
    Cooper Flourens

    Basic Outline of How this Works:
        1. Get information on all events from database
        2. Get the total work/stressful events and multiply them by the maximum stress report value
        3. Get total leisure events and multiply them by the weight, potentially based on the lenghth of time they take?
        4. Calculate stress level by:
            (sum of reported stress level of events - leisure events * weight + survey results centered around 0 * weight) / max stress level
        5. Return stress level
    
    Some current notes:
        Currently waiting on survey data to be implemented, and figure out the right weights for each category.
        We may also want to intake a "wind down" rating for different types of leisure events, and use that as sort of the reverse of the stress events.
