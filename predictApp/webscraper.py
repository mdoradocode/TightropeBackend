"""

This is a webscraper that will find events in a user's city. The categories will hopefully be inputs from a user, and the city will be selected by the user.

If there are no categoires, don't worry about it. It should be fine.

This webscraper uses Ticketpy, a wrapper of the TicketMaster API, to find events near a user in the categories they like.

The Ticketpy library was created by Edward Wells and can be found here:
    https://github.com/arcward/ticketpy

This library can be installed using pip:
    pip install ticketpy

It utilizes the TicketMaster API, which can be found here:
    https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery/v2/

This was built by Cooper Flourens
